# Password-Generator 

## Description
This was rebuilt with my own code to differentiate from the starter code and make certain properties work for the password generator to operate appropriately. It helps with sharpening my skills for Javascript. This password generator will create a password consisted of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters. It will also prompt you to answer whether you want certain characters apart of your password such as lowercase and uppercase letters, as well as numbers and special characters. 

## Installation
The steps to installing this page required you to have to clone the starter code that was given. It then has to be modified to match the user story and acceptance criteria such as the type of characters you would want the password to consist of. 

## Usage
At the beginning of page, you will be prompted with a big button to generate a password. Clicking that button will present four pop-up prompts that all ask questions considering the characters and types of characters for your random password.
